> A professional, comprehensive collection of TradingView Pine Script v6 indicators and strategies with integrated documentation, development tools, and CI/CD workflows.

This repository serves as a comprehensive, high-quality, open-source collection of TradingView Pine Script v6 indicators and strategies, complete with integrated Sphinx documentation and Docker support. It is designed to promote best practices in Pine Script development, provide robust examples for traders and developers, facilitate learning, and enable advanced use cases such as LLM (Large Language Model) agent integration and systematic backtesting.

The primary audience for this repository includes Pine Script developers of all skill levels, quantitative analysts, traders seeking to automate or enhance their strategies, and AI developers interested in leveraging structured financial script repositories.

## Key Features:

*   **Curated Indicators & Strategies:** A selection of commonly used indicators and strategy archetypes, implemented with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and adherence to Pine Script v6 standards.
*   **Sphinx Documentation:** Comprehensive HTML documentation automatically generated from Markdown files, providing detailed explanations for each script and guideline.
*   **Docker Support:** Easy local deployment of the documentation server using Docker and Docker Compose.
*   **Coding & Contribution Guidelines:** Detailed standards for writing and contributing Pine Script code, ensuring quality and consistency.
*   **LLM Agent Integration Framework:** Guidance on how the repository's structure and content facilitate interaction with LLMs for code generation, analysis, and modification.
*   **Backtesting & Optimization Guidance:** Principles and metrics for robust strategy backtesting and a conceptual framework for a feedback loop to improve strategies.

The establishment of such a structured repository, equipped with professional development tooling like Sphinx for documentation and Docker for deployment, aims to elevate the standard within the Pine Script community. Many Pine Script users are primarily traders, and providing a familiar software engineering framework can lower the barrier to creating high-quality, maintainable scripts. This structured approach fosters a more robust ecosystem beyond loosely organized script collections.

Furthermore, the explicit consideration of LLM agent integration from the outset is a forward-looking approach. As AI-assisted development and analysis become more prevalent in finance, a repository designed for LLM consumption can serve as a valuable dataset and tool. This can accelerate innovation in AI-driven strategy development, backtesting analysis, and even automated script modification. The quality of this integration, and indeed the overall utility for human contributors, hinges on clear and comprehensive documentation. Detailed Markdown files and a well-configured Sphinx setup provide a dual benefit, enhancing usability for both human developers and AI agents.
