# Multi-Timeframe Trend Following Strategy

## Overview

The Multi-Timeframe Trend Following Strategy is a comprehensive trend-following system that combines multiple moving averages with higher timeframe analysis to identify and trade strong trending movements. The strategy uses strict risk management rules and multiple filters to improve trade quality and reduce false signals.

## Strategy Logic

### Core Concept
This strategy operates on the principle that trends on higher timeframes provide the dominant direction, while lower timeframe signals provide precise entry timing. By aligning trades with the higher timeframe trend and using moving average crossovers for entries, the strategy aims to capture significant trending moves while avoiding counter-trend trades.

### Signal Generation
- **Entry Signal**: Fast SMA crossing above/below Slow SMA
- **Trend Filter**: Price must be above/below the Trend SMA
- **HTF Filter**: Higher timeframe trend must align with trade direction
- **Volume Filter**: Current volume must exceed the volume threshold
- **Time Filter**: Optional trading hours restriction

## Entry Conditions

### Long Entry
All of the following conditions must be met:
1. **Crossover Signal**: Fast SMA crosses above Slow SMA
2. **Trend Confirmation**: Current price > Trend SMA (200-period)
3. **Volume Confirmation**: Current volume > Volume SMA × Threshold
4. **Time Filter**: Current time within trading hours (if enabled)
5. **HTF Filter**: Higher timeframe trend is bullish (if enabled)
6. **Position**: No existing position

### Short Entry
All of the following conditions must be met:
1. **Crossunder Signal**: Fast SMA crosses below Slow SMA
2. **Trend Confirmation**: Current price < Trend SMA (200-period)

### Take Profit
- **Long**: Entry price + (Entry price × Take Profit %)
- **Short**: Entry price - (Entry price × Take Profit %)

### Trailing Stop
Activated when unrealized profit reaches the Trailing Start % threshold:
- **Long**: Stop price = Current price - (Current price × Trailing Offset %)
- **Short**: Stop price = Current price + (Current price × Trailing Offset %)

## Risk-Reward Profile

### Default Configuration

2. **Different market conditions**: Test in trending and ranging periods
3. **Multiple timeframes**: Validate across various chart timeframes
4. **Different assets**: Test on correlated and uncorrelated instruments

## Implementation Tips

### Setup Process
1. **Choose primary timeframe** based on trading style
2. **Set higher timeframe** (4-6 times higher than primary)
3. **Adjust risk parameters** based on account size and risk tolerance
4. **Enable appropriate filters** for your trading environment
5. **Backtest thoroughly** before live implementation

### Risk Management Best Practices
- **Never risk more than 1-2%** of account per trade
- **Adjust position sizes** based on volatility
- **Monitor correlation** across multiple positions

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Over-optimization**: Avoid curve-fitting to historical data
