# Adaptive Volatility Compression Breakout with Multi-Stage Confirmation

## Overview

The Adaptive Volatility Compression Breakout (AVCB) strategy is a sophisticated trading system that identifies periods of low volatility (compression or "squeeze") and captures breakout movements with multiple confirmation layers. This strategy combines technical analysis concepts from Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channels, and advanced momentum indicators to create a robust breakout trading system with comprehensive risk management.

## Description

The strategy operates on the principle that periods of low volatility are often followed by periods of high volatility and significant price movements. By identifying when Bollinger Bands contract inside Keltner Channels (creating a "squeeze"), the strategy prepares for potential breakout opportunities. The multi-stage confirmation system ensures that only high-probability setups are traded by requiring alignment across multiple timeframes, momentum indicators, and market regime filters.

The strategy is designed for traders who prefer systematic, rule-based approaches to breakout trading and can be applied across various instruments and timeframes, though it performs best in trending markets with sufficient volatility.

## Strategy Logic

### Entry Rules

**Long Entry:**
- Volatility compression (squeeze) detected in previous bars
- Price breaks above Keltner Channel upper band
- Higher timeframe trend is bullish (optional filter)
- MACD histogram shows increasing bullish momentum (optional filter)
- ADX indicates trending market conditions (optional filter)
- Volume exceeds average by specified factor (optional filter)
- No existing position

**Short Entry:**
- Volatility compression (squeeze) detected in previous bars
- Price breaks below Keltner Channel lower band
- Higher timeframe trend is bearish (optional filter)
- MACD histogram shows increasing bearish momentum (optional filter)
- ADX indicates trending market conditions (optional filter)
- Volume exceeds average by specified factor (optional filter)
- No existing position

### Exit Rules

**Stop Loss:**
- ATR-based stop loss calculation
- Default: 2.0 × ATR from entry price
- Adapts to market volatility automatically

**Take Profit:**
- Primary target: 1.5 × ATR from entry price
- Secondary target: 3.0 × ATR from entry price
- Risk-reward ratio optimized for breakout characteristics

**Trailing Stop:**
- Activated after first take profit level is reached
- Distance: 1.5 × ATR from current price
- Protects profits while allowing trend continuation
